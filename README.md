# apheleia 0.0.1

"In Greek mythology, Apheleia was the spirit and personification of ease, simplicity and primitivity in the good sense, 'the good old days'." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheleia)

apheleia is a CLI-based planner/agenda written in C++. It has very basic functionality at the current moment such as adding and removing tasks. I plan to add more functionality in the future, but it will take a little.

## Usage

Currently, there is no .exe and if you want to then feel free to compile it yourself, but it is not ready for public use.

## Compilation
